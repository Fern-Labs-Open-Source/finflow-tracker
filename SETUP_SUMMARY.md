# FinFlow Tracker - Setup Summary

## ✅ Completed Setup Tasks

### Step 3: Development Environment Setup

This document summarizes the development environment setup and test contribution that was completed to ensure the project is ready for development.

## 🔧 What Was Set Up

### 1. **Git Authentication**
- ✅ Configured HTTPS authentication with GitHub OAuth token
- ✅ Set up credential helper for automatic authentication
- ✅ Verified push/pull access to the repository

### 2. **Dependencies Installation**
- ✅ All npm packages successfully installed
- ✅ Fixed package.json (removed non-existent gitleaks npm package)
- ✅ Generated package-lock.json for consistent installs

### 3. **Development Documentation**
- ✅ Created comprehensive `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` with:
  - Quick start instructions
  - Project structure overview
  - Development workflow
  - Testing guidelines
  - Common issues and solutions
  
- ✅ Created `CONTRIBUTING.md` with:
  - Contribution guidelines
  - Code style requirements
  - PR process
  - Issue templates

### 4. **Automated Setup Script**
- ✅ Created `scripts/setup-dev.sh` that:
  - Checks Node.js/npm versions
  - Installs dependencies
  - Sets up environment variables
  - Configures database
  - Sets up git hooks
  - Provides clear next steps

### 5. **Test Contribution**
- ✅ Created `WelcomeCard` component as example
- ✅ Added comprehensive unit tests
- ✅ Created utility functions library
- ✅ Demonstrated the full development workflow

## 📝 Important Notes for Contributors

### Known Limitations
1. **GitHub Actions**: The current OAuth token doesn't have permissions to create/modify workflow files. These need to be added manually through the GitHub UI or with a token that has `workflow` scope.

2. **SSH Keys**: SSH authentication couldn't be set up automatically due to OAuth token limitations. HTTPS with token authentication is configured instead.

### Environment Variables Required
Contributors need to set up `.env.local` with:
- `DATABASE_URL` - Neon PostgreSQL connection
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - Authentication secret
- `ADMIN_EMAIL` - Admin user email
- `EXCHANGERATE_API_KEY` - Exchange rate API key (optional for free tier)

### Quick Start Commands
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/Fern-Labs-Open-Source/finflow-tracker.git
cd finflow-tracker
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your values

# Run setup script
bash scripts/setup-dev.sh

# Start development
npm run dev
```

## 🚀 Ready for Development

The repository is now fully set up and ready for contributions. Any developer or agent can:

1. Clone the repository
2. Follow the DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md
3. Make contributions following CONTRIBUTING.md
4. Push changes using the configured HTTPS authentication
