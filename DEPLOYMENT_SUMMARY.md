- ⏳ **GitHub Actions Workflows** (Require manual addition)
  - `ci.yml` - Main CI pipeline
  - `pr-checks.yml` - PR-specific checks
  - Files saved in `/workflows-to-add/` for manual addition

### Deployment Process

#### Simple Deployment Flow:
1. **Create feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature
   ```

2. **Make changes and commit**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: description"
   ```

3. **Push and create PR**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature
   ```

4. **After merge to main**
   - Netlify automatically deploys
   - Monitor at: https://app.netlify.com/sites/finflow-tracker-fern/deploys

### Quick Commands

```bash
# Check if ready to deploy
npm run deploy:check

# Check production status
npm run deploy:status

# View deployment logs
# Go to: https://app.netlify.com/sites/finflow-tracker-fern/deploys

# Quick health check
curl https://finflow-tracker-fern.netlify.app/api/ping
```

### Rollback Instructions

#### Option 1: Via Netlify (Fastest)
1. Go to [Deploys page](https://app.netlify.com/sites/finflow-tracker-fern/deploys)
2. Find last working deployment
3. Click "Publish deploy"

#### Option 2: Via Git
```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
git push origin main
```

### Environment Variables (Set in Netlify)

| Variable | Description | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| DATABASE_URL | Neon PostgreSQL connection | ✅ Set |
| NEXTAUTH_SECRET | Authentication secret | ✅ Set |
| NEXTAUTH_URL | Production URL | ✅ Set |

- ✅ Environment variables secured in Netlify
- ✅ Database using SSL connections

### Success Metrics

- ✅ Zero-downtime deployments
- ✅ Automatic deployments on merge
- ✅ Rollback capability < 1 minute
- ✅ Health monitoring available
- ✅ Documentation complete

## Summary

The deployment infrastructure is fully operational with:
- Automatic deployments from GitHub to Netlify
- Complete documentation and scripts
- Health monitoring and rollback procedures
- Secure environment configuration

The only pending item is adding GitHub Actions workflows, which require special permissions but are not blocking deployments.
