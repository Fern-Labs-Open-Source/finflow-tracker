- Environment variables configured
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Publish directory: `.next`

### Deployment Checklist for Authentication Update

After merging PR #4 (Multi-User Authentication):

1. **Update Environment Variables on Netlify:**
   ```
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<generate-new-secret>  # Generate with: openssl rand -base64 32
   NEXTAUTH_URL=https://finflow-tracker-fern.netlify.app
   BYPASS_AUTH=false  # Turn off auth bypass
   DATABASE_URL=<keep-existing>
   ```

2. **Database Migration:**
   - The Prisma migration will run automatically during build
   - Or manually run: `npx prisma migrate deploy`

3. **Optional OAuth Setup (add when ready):**
   ```
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<from-google-console>
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<from-google-console>
   GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<from-github-settings>
   GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=<from-github-settings>
   ```
   - OAuth will work immediately once these are added
   - No code changes needed!

### Local Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run database migrations
npx prisma migrate dev
