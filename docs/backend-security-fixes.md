# Backend Security Fixes Documentation

## Critical Issues Addressed

This document outlines the critical security and functionality issues that were fixed in the FinFlow Tracker backend.

## 1. Multi-User Data Isolation Bug

### Issue
All users were seeing the same financial data because API endpoints were not filtering by authenticated user ID.

### Root Cause
- `/api/portfolio/quick-stats` was fetching ALL accounts from the database
- `/api/portfolio/performance` was not filtering snapshots by user
- Portfolio service methods were missing userId parameters

### Fix Applied
```typescript
// Before (VULNERABLE):
const accounts = await prisma.account.findMany({
  where: { 
    isActive: true,
  },
  // Missing userId filter!
});

// After (SECURE):
const accounts = await prisma.account.findMany({
  where: { 
    userId: req.userId!, // Now properly filtered
    isActive: true,
  },
});
```

### Files Modified
- `app/api/portfolio/quick-stats/route.ts`
- `app/api/portfolio/performance/route.ts`
- `src/lib/services/portfolio.service.ts`

## 2. Empty Portfolio Calculation Bug

### Issue
When users deleted all their institutions/accounts, the portfolio still showed stale values instead of 0.

### Root Cause
The API wasn't handling empty account lists properly and was returning undefined calculations.

### Fix Applied
```typescript
// Handle empty portfolio case
if (accounts.length === 0 || totalValueEUR === 0) {
  return NextResponse.json({
    totalValue: {
      eur: 0,
      formatted: '€0.00',
    },
    dailyChange: {
      amount: 0,
      percent: 0,
      formatted: '€0.00 (0.00%)',
    },
    accountCount: 0,
    distribution: {
      byType: [],
      byCurrency: [],
      byInstitution: [],
    },
    lastUpdated: new Date().toISOString(),
  }, { headers: CacheHeaders.shortCache });
}
```

## 3. Test Infrastructure Improvements

### Issue
No way to test multi-user scenarios effectively.

### Fix Applied
Enhanced the development auth bypass to support multiple test users:

```typescript
// Check for specific test user ID in headers
const testUserId = req.headers.get('X-Test-User-Id') || 'test-user-id';
const testUserEmail = req.headers.get('X-Test-User-Email') || `${testUserId}@example.com`;

authReq.userId = testUserId;
authReq.userEmail = testUserEmail;
```

### New Test Infrastructure
- `scripts/setup-test-users.ts` - Creates test users in database
- `test-isolation.js` - Simple test runner for validation
- `tests/api/multi-user-isolation.test.ts` - Comprehensive test suite

## Testing

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Run test setup
npx tsx scripts/setup-test-users.ts

# Run isolation tests
node test-isolation.js
```

### Test Coverage
✅ User data isolation
✅ Portfolio calculations
✅ Cascade deletion
✅ Empty state handling
✅ Cross-user data protection
✅ New user initialization

## Security Impact

### Before
- **Critical**: All users could see each other's financial data
- **Critical**: User A could potentially modify User B's accounts
- **High**: No validation of ownership before operations

### After
- All API endpoints properly filter by authenticated user ID
- Ownership validation on all mutation operations
- Proper cascade deletion maintaining data integrity
- Zero-value portfolios for new/empty accounts

## Performance Considerations

The fixes add minimal overhead:
- One additional WHERE clause per query
- No additional database round trips
- Caching headers remain in place

## Deployment Notes

These fixes should be deployed immediately as they address critical security vulnerabilities.

### Migration Steps
1. Deploy backend fixes
2. No database migrations required
3. Clear any cached portfolio data
4. Monitor for any auth-related errors

## Monitoring

After deployment, monitor for:
- Authentication errors (401s)
- Empty portfolio responses
- User complaints about missing data

## Future Improvements

1. Add database indexes on userId columns for better performance
2. Implement row-level security (RLS) at database level
3. Add audit logging for financial operations
4. Implement rate limiting per user
5. Add comprehensive integration tests for all user scenarios
